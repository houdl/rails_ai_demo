  def build_google_play_instructions(review_count)
    <<~INSTRUCTIONS
      Please help me extract app reviews from this Google Play Store page. Follow these steps:

      1. First, take a screenshot to see the current page
      2. Scroll down to find the "See all reviews" section or button
      3. Click on "See all reviews" to open the reviews section
      4. Once in the "Ratings and reviews" section, scroll through and collect #{review_count} user reviews
      5. For each review, extract:
         - Rating (number of stars)
         - Review text/content
         - Reviewer name (if visible)
         - Review date (if visible)
      6. After collecting the reviews, provide a summary of the common themes and sentiments

      Please be thorough and take screenshots at each major step so I can see the progress.
      Return the extracted reviews in a structured format and provide an overall summary of the user feedback.
